User Interface Section

The user interface of the surveillance system will be designed to provide efficient management and oversight of surveillance alerts and cases, as well as configuration capabilities for administrators. The user interface will consist of three tabs within the portal: Alert Management, Case Management, and Admin.

Alert Management Tab:

The Alert Management tab will display all surveillance alerts.
Users will have the ability to filter alerts based on various criteria such as time range, symbol, alert type, and assignee.
The interface will provide options for sorting and prioritizing alerts based on urgency and relevance.
Users can acknowledge and take actions on alerts directly from this tab.
Case Management Tab:

The Case Management tab will facilitate the structured handling and resolution of alerts triggered by the surveillance system.
Users will be able to create cases, associate alerts with cases, and manage the workflow of cases.
Each case will follow a workflow of statuses including open, in progress, resolved, and closed.
Users can add context and details to cases, assign tasks to team members, and track the progress of case resolution.
Admin Tab:

The Admin tab will be accessible only to users with administrative privileges.
It will serve multiple purposes:
Data Visualization Tools: Users will have access to graphical representations and numerical summaries of surveillance data, allowing for deeper analysis and insights.
Configuration Parameters: Administrators can configure parameters related to alert settings, such as thresholds and sensitivity levels.
Rule Configuration: Administrators will be able to define rules for assigning alerts to specific users based on predefined criteria.
The user interface will prioritize user-friendly design principles, intuitive navigation, and responsiveness to ensure an optimal user experience. Additionally, role-based access control mechanisms will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
