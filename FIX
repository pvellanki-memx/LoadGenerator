MEMO FIX (US Equities)
Overview
The MEMO FIX protocol is the application layer message standard used to facilitate the electronic exchange of information related to
securities transactions placed on the MEMX exchange. MEMO FIX is a text key=value formatted protocol based on the FIX Trading
Community FIX 5.0 SP2 specifications.
Transport Layer
The MEMO FIX protocol uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to provide reliable and ordered delivery of messages between
clients and MEMO servers.
Session Layer
The MEMO FIX protocol uses the FIXT 1.1 specification session messages to establish and maintain a session.
Application Layer
MEMO FIX protocol application layer messages are based on the Financial Information Exchange (FIX) Protocol version 5.0 and are
key=value text encoded.
Headers and Trailers
All messages begin with a Standard Header and must end with a Standard Trailer.
Standard Header
The Standard Header must contain the required fields listed and can contain any of the non-required listed fields:
8 BeginString Y "FIXT.1.1" This must be the first field in the message.
9 BodyLength Y The length of the FIX message. This must be the second field in the message.
35 MsgType Y The type of message. This must be the third field in the message.
49 SenderCompID Y The sender's id, assigned by MEMX at on-boarding time.
56 TargetCompID Y "MEMX"
34 MsgSeqNum Y The message sequence number.
52 SendingTime Y The time of message transmission in Universal Time coordinated. See UTCTimestamp in
FIX 5.0 SP2 specification.
43 PossDupFlag N Always required for retransmitted messages, whether prompted by the sending system or
as the result of a resend request.
97 PossResend N Required when message may be duplicate of another message sent under a different
sequence number.
122 OrigSendingTime N Required for message resent as a result of a ResendRequest. If data is not available set to
same value as SendingTime.
Tag Field Name Req'd Meaning/Values
Standard Trailer
The Standard Trailer must contain the CheckSum field.
Messages
This section defines the messages that make up the protocol. For each message, it lists the fields in the message by tag id and name,
whether the field is required and acceptable values or description of the field. MEMX will reject any messages that contain unspecified tags.
Session Messages
This section defines the session level messages supported.
Heartbeat (Sent by exchange and client)
The Heartbeat message confirms the status of the communication link.
Logon
The logon message is sent by the client to establish a connection to the exchange. The logon message must be the first message sent by
the application requesting to initiate a FIX session.
Note: In version 1.9 and beyond, if the DefaultCstmApplVerID (tag 1408) is invalid, the client connection is dropped.
Logout
The logout message initiates or confirms the termination of a FIX session. This may be sent by the exchange or the client.
10 CheckSum Y The message checksum. This must be the last field in the message.

98 EncryptMethod Y Required to be 0.
108 HeartBtInt Y Heartbeat interval, in seconds. An interval of 0 indicates there are no heartbeats. The maximum supported interval is 90 seconds.
141 ResetSeqNumFlag N MEMX will reject logon if this flag is 'Y'. MEMX operations can reset the inbound and outbound sequence numbers on request.
1137 DefaultApplVerID Y Required to be 9. ("FIX50SP2")
1408 DefaultCstmApplVerID Y The schema version, required as of version 1.9, is used to ensure consistency across message formats.

Reject
The reject message should be issued when a message is received but cannot be properly processed due to a session-level rule violation.
ResendRequest
The resend request is sent by the receiving application to initiate the retransmission of messages.
SequenceReset
The sequence reset message is used to reset the incoming sequence number on the opposing side.
TestRequest
The test request message forces a heartbeat from the opposing application. The opposite application responds to the Test Request with a
Heartbeat containing the TestReqID.

BusinessMessageReject
MEMX will not send any BusinessMessageReject messages. Instead MEMX will send either a Reject for session level issues or the
appropriate application reject message.MEMX does support receiving BusinessMessageReject messages from the client.
Session Management
The client establishes a session by opening a TCP connection to an exchange Memo FIX port, (server) and sending a FIX logon message
with the appropriate credentials and MsgSeqNum set. Values for SenderCompID and TargetCompID will be provisioned by the exchange
and will be verified by the server upon receipt of the Logon message. If the Logon message is accepted, the server will send a Logon
response. If the MsgSeqNum on the inbound logon is less than expected by the server, the logon will be rejected.
If the MsgSeqNum on the inbound logon is greater than expected, the server will reply with a Logon and shall send a ResendRequest for
the missing messages. The client application should gap fill any session level messages and may opt to resend any business level
messages with the PossDup flag set (see FIXT 1.1 specification Message Recovery). For example, if a client opts to resend a stale
NewOrderSingle during a gap fill, the server will process the message, and that order may become eligible for execution.
When the client application receives the Logon response it should compare the MsgSeqNum to the expected server sequence number. If a
gap is detected, it should send a ResendRequest message to the server. The server will resend any missing business level messages with
the PossDup flag set. Instead of resending session-level messages, the server will issue sequence reset messages with the GapFillFlag
set.
If the session gets interrupted intra-day and cancel on disconnect is enabled for the port, the server will cancel all orders associated with
that session. The Canceled execution reports generated by the cancel on disconnect shall be stored by the server, and will be available for
resending when the client re-establishes the session. If cancel on disconnect is not provisioned, then any orders that were active when the
connection was closed shall be eligible for execution. By default cancel on disconnect is enabled.
When the client terminates a session it should send a Logout message and wait for the Logout response from the server before closing the
connection. This procedure facilitates gap detection and processing before the connection is closed.
At the end of the trading day, the FIX inbound and outbound sequence numbers are set to 1. All inbound FIX messages shall be rejected if
a FIX session has not been established. The server will send a Logout if it receives a message without PossDup flag set, and with a
MsgSeqNum less than the expected client sequence number. In the event of a failover to a backup port, the backup port will maintain the
sequence numbers of the primary, and it will have the ability to replay any messages that the primary port sent.
The server will process any business level messages with the PossResend flag set. The server will reject any messages that it has already
seen-- for example, NewOrderSingle or CancelReplace messages with duplicate ClOrdID.

Restatement
The Restatement execution report is is an unsolicited event to notify the client that an open order has been updated by the MEMX system.
This message may be sent for orders configured for automatic repricing via the RepriceFrequency instruction. A restatement message will
be sent if the order quantity is partially or fully cancelled because of Self Trade Prevention. This message will not be sent for Pegged
Orders. In version 1.9 and beyond, clients can elect to receive an optional Restatement execution report when an order is booked and it
either sets a new NBBO, or joins the existing NBBO.
NOTE: This message will be sent in the case of an order entered with the SingleReprice instruction, when the system is able to display the
order at the booking price, if the order was repriced and displayed away from its booking price upon entry. In this case, the lastPx field will
be the same as the previous Restatement, to indicate that the position on order book has not changed, but the message still will be sent to
allow for correlation with the displayed orders on the MEMOIR Depth feed.
