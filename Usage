Load Generator Framework
The Load Generator Framework is a flexible and configurable tool for generating load on a trading system using the FIX protocol. It allows you to establish multiple FIX sessions, generate and send load messages, and track the performance of your trading system.

Features
Establish multiple FIX sessions with configurable connection settings.
Generate load messages based on provided templates and probabilities.
Control the message rate and adjust it dynamically during the load test.
Pause and resume the load generation process.
Track the number of established sessions.
Configurable through a configuration file.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (install using pip):
fixmsg (FIX message library)
pandas (data analysis library)
Getting Started
Clone or download the Load Generator Framework repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a configuration file (config.ini) with the following sections and options:

[Load] section:
message_rate - The initial message rate (messages per second).
[Session_<session_id>] sections (one for each FIX session):
host - The host address of the trading system.
port - The port number for establishing the FIX session.
sender - The sender ID for the FIX session.
target - The target ID for the FIX session.
[MessageTemplates] section:
Specify the message types and their probabilities:
makefile
Copy code
[MessageTemplates]
NewOrderSingle = 0.5
OrderCancelRequest = 0.3
ExecutionReport = 0.2
Note: You can include additional configuration options according to your requirements.

Customize the message templates by creating template files (e.g., new_order_single.template, order_cancel_request.template, etc.) in the templates directory. Replace the dynamic fields in the templates with appropriate placeholders (e.g., <Sender>, <Target>, etc.) to be filled in during message generation.

Run the load generator using the following command:

Copy code
python load_generator.py
The load generator will establish the FIX sessions, generate and send load messages based on the configured parameters, and display the progress and statistics.

Follow the on-screen instructions to pause, resume, change the message rate, or quit the load generator.

Results and Reporting
The load generator provides real-time progress updates during the load test. Additionally, it generates a log file (load_generator.log) that contains detailed information about the load test, including the sent messages, timestamps, and any errors encountered.
